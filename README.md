# ProjectileMotion

this is a simple project to compute how far can you thrown/launch something with an especific angle or what angle it needs to be to throw something that far

```py
# TO FIND THE DISTANCE
print(find_distance(8.5, 30, 100))

# TO DETERMIN THE ANGLE
print(find_angle(8.5, 36.57, 100))
```
